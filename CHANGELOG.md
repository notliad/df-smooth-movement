# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Follow the camera during a pan instead of resetting: in-flight movements are translated by the
  map-scroll delta so sprites track the scrolled world rather than floating, and are dropped only
  once they scroll off-screen. Zoom, Z-level, resize, and viewport changes still reset.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-28

- Add a Windows x86-64 build for DFHack 53.15-r2.
- Load SDL2 by its platform-specific library name.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-28

- Add smooth visual interpolation for adjacent creature movement.
- Preserve world layer ordering and render UI after animated creatures.
- Reset interpolation on camera, zoom, Z-level, resize, or viewport changes.
- Keep gameplay, simulation timing, and save data unchanged.
