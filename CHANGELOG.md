# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Target DFHack `develop` and reuse DFHack's SDL library handle instead of
  independently opening and closing SDL.
- Centralize viewport layer metadata, redraw stages, SDL bindings, and pending
  state cleanup to remove duplicated rendering policy.
- Animate creature status icons with their creature instead of letting their
  flashing texture fragments jump between tiles.
- Animate item-layer wheelbarrows and the vehicle layer used by minecarts;
  minecart sprite changes no longer interrupt interpolation, and consecutive
  steps retarget from the current fractional position instead of snapping back
  to the previous tile center.
- Optional free camera (`smooth-movement camera on`, off by default): map scrolls
  glide with an exponential catch-up, middle-mouse drag pans pixel-perfectly and
  can rest between tiles, and `camera <fx> <fy>` sets a persistent sub-tile
  offset. Render-only; the game's tile camera is untouched.
- Fix sprites floating while the camera pans. The scroll variables change at input time but the
  viewport buffers shift on a later render frame, where the shift used to read as a real creature
  move and started a bogus slide across the screen. The buffer shift is now detected directly
  (hypothesis-tested against the pending scroll delta): new-movement detection is suppressed while
  a pan is pending, and in-flight movements are translated on the frame the shift lands so they
  keep tracking the world. Zoom, Z-level, resize, and viewport changes still reset.
